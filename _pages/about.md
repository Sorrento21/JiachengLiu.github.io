**Hi! This is Jiacheng Liu (Jason) speaking.**

Iâ€™m an undergraduate in [Creative Design and Intelligent Engineering (CDIE)](https://www.xyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1111/1374.htm) at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm), a cross-disciplinary field within the realm of automation. My coursework in automation, machinery, and design has cultivated a broad academic perspective and fostered my creativity.
