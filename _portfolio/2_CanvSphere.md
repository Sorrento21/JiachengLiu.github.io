    <!-- Project Description -->
    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #34495E; text-align: justify;">
        CanvSphere is a tailored XR urban art festival designed to promote the distinctive features of a target city and create a city landmark. 
        By soliciting paid submissions from artists, CanvSphere gathers XR artistic creations. 
        During the art festival, visitors can wear XR headsets to view artworks by various artists and engage in their own creative activities in designated public art creation areas. 
        Through the festival, we aim to allow visitors to experience the city’s culture and landscapes, fostering a spontaneous love for the urban environment.

    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #34495E; text-align: justify;">Art festivals have become a contemporary trend, and many cities have received positive responses from hosting such events. 
    We have designed a city-specific XR art festival solution for urban managers to enhance city visibility and create a city landmark. 
    Urban managers can collect and select outstanding 3D XR hybrid artworks through a call for submissions to artists, 
    leading to XR art exhibitions and public art creation activities. We present our solution using Copenhagen as an example.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #34495E; text-align: justify;">We crafted an art festival proposal for Copenhagen, themed around Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tales. 
    Visitors can wear XR glasses to explore virtual artworks along the streets, 
    showcasing a unique fusion of virtual creations and cityscapes. They can also participate in creating their own works at the Palace Square. 
    Throughout the streets, visitors will encounter various styles of classic characters such as the Little Mermaid and the Ugly Duckling. 
    To enhance the festival’s entertainment value, we incorporated elements of treasure hunting in the art exhibition and interactive opportunities to take photos with virtual artworks.</p>
