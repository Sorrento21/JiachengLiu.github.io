    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #34495E; text-align: justify;">
        Targeting issues such as difficulty retrieving photos, cumbersome usage, and a lack of entertainment elements in existing photo albums, I collaborated with my team to design a UI for a personalized album app based on tags, known as TagMagnet. TagMagnet simplifies album categorization and creation by allowing users to assign tags to each photo while taking pictures. Users can easily create new albums, select multiple photos, and retrieve images conveniently. Additionally, TagMagnet can generate summary albums for users, facilitating photo review and preserving memories.

    In this project, we addressed two pain points in existing photo albums: difficulty in photo categorization and retrieval, and a lack of personalized elements in albums.
    To tackle the first pain point, we adopted a semi-automatic tagging approach to assign tags to each photo. Users can create tags they plan to use frequently and add them to photos by selecting tags while taking pictures or by assigning tags to multiple photos in a tagged album.

    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.6; color: #34495E; text-align: justify;">
    Photos with assigned tags are well-organized and easily retrievable. Users can create albums by selecting tags or retrieve photos by adding tags.
    To introduce personalized elements, we designed the app to regularly push a series of personal summary albums. We named this feature the “Magnet Wall,” where memory albums are reminiscent of magnets on a wall, accessible for browsing or playback. Recognizing the habits and needs of contemporary youth to browse photo albums, we considered this feature essential.

    We completed the entire UI of the app using Figma. It achieves all the expected interactions with a high level of completion. The logic flows seamlessly, fulfilling the intended functions and solving the targeted issues effectively. Our UI draws inspiration from the designs of multiple mobile UIs, achieving a balance between aesthetics and practicality.

        <li>Identified the user pain point of insufficiently intelligent photo classification on mobile phones, making it difficult to retrieve target photos.</li>
        <li>Designed the overall album style and proposed the idea of classifying photos based on tags.</li>
        <li>Developed a complete tag-based usage flow and designed various possible usage scenarios to illustrate the convenience of the proposed method.</li>
        <li>Used Figma for UI design to showcase the envisioned interaction model."</li>
